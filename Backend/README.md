# Backend API Documentation

## `/user/register` Endpoint

### Description


Registers a new user by creating a user account with the provided information 


### HTTP Method

  `post`

### Request Body

Validation rules enforced by the server:

- `fullname`(object):
- `firstname`: required, minimum length 3
- `lastname`: required, minimum length 3
- `email`: required, must be a valid email
- `password`: required, minimum length 6

## Notes

- The endpoint expects `fullname` to be an object with `firstname` and `lastname` fields.
- On success the response includes a JWT token generated by the user model (`generateAuthToken`).
- Ensure `process.env.JWT_SECRET` is set in your environment when running the server so tokens can be issued.

## `/user/login` Endpoint

### Description

Authenticates a user using email and password and returns a JWT token on success.

### HTTP Method

  `post`

### Request Body

Validation rules enforced by the server:

- `email`: required, must be a valid email
- `password`: required, minimum length 6

### Success Response (200)

Returns a JSON object containing the JWT token and the user record (excluding the hashed password):

- `token`: JWT string
- `user`: user object (id, fullname, email, ...)

### Error Responses

- `400` — Validation errors (missing/invalid fields). Response contains `errors` array from express-validator.
- `401` — Invalid credentials (email not found or password mismatch).

### Notes

- The login handler selects the user's `password` field explicitly when querying the database to verify credentials.
- On successful authentication the user model's `generateAuthToken` is used to produce the JWT; ensure `process.env.JWT_SECRET` is set.
- The route is defined as `POST /user/login` in `routes/user.routes.js` and expects body fields `email` and `password`.
